////each of the following two code segments prints out the first ten odd integers.   
int n = 10, int i=1;
while(i<=2*n-1){

}
/// (a)For the code segment on the top, what would be the output if we had 
//// forgotten to include the pair of braces ? Explain your answer.
//// the output would be 1 forever b/c i never changes b/c it is outside the while loop
///(b)For the code segment on the bottom, what would be the output if we had 
//// forgotten to include the pair of braces ? Explain your answer.
//// the output would be 19, the while loop increments i by 2 till i = 19 the i(19) is printed out
